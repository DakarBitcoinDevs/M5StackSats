# M5StackSats
A bitcoin lightning network point of sale terminal using the ESP32 based M5Stack Faces Development Kit. Included in the kit is a keypad and charging dock, making it an ideal candidate for an cheap($55)/easy DIY bitcoin point of sale terminal.

There are two implementations of M5StackSats, one that communicates directly with an LND node, and another that communicates with opennode (make an account here https://opennode.co/join/f774f2a0-1377-45e2-b719-6b821f24900d). 

Converting the project to communicate with c-lightning nodes/other custodial services shouldn't be hard.
