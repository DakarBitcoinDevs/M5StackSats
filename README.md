# M5StackSats
A bitcoin lightning network point of sale terminal using the ESP32 based M5Stack Faces Development Kit. Included in the kit is a keypad and charging dock, making it an ideal candidate for an cheap($55)/easy DIY bitcoin point of sale terminal.

There are two implementations of M5StackSats, one that communicates directly with an LND node, and another that communicates with https://www.opennode.co. Converting the project to communicate with c-lightning nodes/custodial services shouldn't be hard.
